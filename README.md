# SDL RPG experimental game.

An exploration of developing with the [`julia`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) [SimpleDirectMediaLayer.jl](https://github.com/jonathanBieler/SimpleDirectMediaLayer.jl) library.

In this repo, i've started branching some of the shared logic into this library package: https://github.com/NHDaly/SDLGamesLib.jl. That process isn't finished, so there's still an awkward amount of code mixed between the two repos.
